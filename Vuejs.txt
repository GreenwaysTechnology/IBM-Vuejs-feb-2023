What is Vue.js?
  Vue js is a javascript framework for building user interfaces


What is User interface?
  The application where user interacts.

Types of user interface application:

1.Desktop applications
2.Web Applications which is running inside browser
3.Mobile Applications
   Native
   Browser based 
   Hybrid Mobile Application
4.Other devices based Apps

Web Applications:
.................
 The application is built and distributed over internet and accessed by using http protocal.

Types of web application:

Server side Web Application:
.............................
1.Static web apps - 1989 to 1995
https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born

2.Dynamic Content Generation Web App - 1996 to till date
  -CGI - C,Perl
  -J2EE - Java, Servlet
  -ASP - VbScript, vb
  -PHP - PHP
  -.net,nodejs,ruby..rails....
Output: HTML pages generated on fly.

3.Biz to Biz integration:
   Incase two biz organization want to share their information via internet
 DCG technology was not enough.
 Web Services:  1998 to till Date
  COMMON DATA Interchange format
   instead of exchanging html pages we can exchange data in the form of XML
  -XML - Soap Web Services
 2005 on wards - REST Full web services
,.............................................................................
Client side Web Apps:

Browser based :
 Desktop browsers
 Mobile browsers

 Powered with HTML With Javascript 
    Incase of dynamic web apps, html genereated by server and javascript changed and processed html pages at client side.


In 2007,W3c Introduced new web development arch, called "Single Page Web Application/SPA"

In SPA

 Client user interface applications were written using "HTML 5,CSS3,Javascript" where as server side applications are "Web Services-REST API" which serves data to the client.

SPA:
       Client User App (HTML,CSS,JS)<-------------------> REST API

SPA Frameworks:
1.Mustache.js
2.Angular.js
3.React
4.Angular
5.Vue.js

.....................................................................................
			  Client Side Web Technology.

There are there primary languages 
1.HTML 5
2.Javascript 
3.CSS

DOM Programming:
................
What is DOM?

What is HTML? How it works?

HTML is the programming language,DSL / Declarative Programming languge. Domain specific language- Domain specific language is nothing but the language built for sepcific domain, which cant be used for other purposes.

HTML internal work flow:
.......................
index.html -  source code

<html>
 <head>
   <title>HTML</title>
 </head>
 <body>
     <h1>Welcome</h1>
 </body>
</html>
 --------------Browser
  |
 loader : load source code into browser
  |
  uses protocal 
   file or http
  |
  parser : Parser is spcial compiler which converts source code into lexical tree
           (String tree)
   |

html
  head
   title
      HTML
   title
 head
 body
     h1
      Welcome
     h1
 body
html
   |
   compiler: Compilation: convert source code into assembly language
   |
html - LOAD XXX
  head-
   title
      HTML
   title
 head
 body
     h1
      Welcome
     h1
 body
html
.......................&&&&&&&&&&&&&..........................................  
                                Runtime

During runtime, we need to allocate memory for the program.

Runtime will create LinkedList(c) for the entire html document

html - Node
  head-
   title
      HTML
   title
 head
 body -Node
     h1  - Node
      Welcome
     h1
 body
html

Nodes are connected each other in Hierchical Structure(Tree)

Linking the Nodes (Tree)

body -Node
    |
     h1  - Node
      |
        Welcome
     h1
 body
 |
Layout Engine/Paint Engine
   |
  will convert into pxs - Final Ouput

            At End , the html page is "Tree Data Structure"
..........................***.....................................................
			The Netscap Communication and HTML Tree
.................................................................................
Netscap started a project,to access rendered "tree" via program.

Netcap initally decided to introduce c program,later who decided to change their mind to "Java".
Java was not also not suitable , the reason was , java was the big language , putting the language inside browser is not suitable.

Nets cap finally decided who did not want eiter c or java, but java like language
 - "The Birth of Javascript" 

The Javascript was introduced  as light weight programming language to access the tree,process the tree.

How to reprsent html inside javascript engine?
 
 Netscap took an idea "Object" Model.

Every html element is object, which is created once the browser loads the html into browser,and also object can be created using apis..

Javascript engins forms the tree called "Object Tree"
.....................................................................................
			Netscap Object and W3c
.....................................................................................

After Object tree model and javascript success, W3C  decided to standarize this arch/technology.

After standarization, w3c publish a spec called "DOM" -  Document Object Model

How dom works?

index.html           Broser runtime(C program)         Javascript Engine
<h1>Hello</h1>       h1-Node                           h1- Object
			Hello-Node			 Hello Object Property



                Every Html ELEMENT Inside Browser is "C Program"

	        Every Html ELEMENT Inside javascript engine is "Object"

HTML Elements(p,h1,div,img) are  represented inside browser as "Node", inside Javascript Engine "Object - DOM "


javascript developer ---->uses api --->to communicate Object---->js engine---->browser engine.
.....................................................................................
				DOM Programming
.....................................................................................

How to implement dom programming?

1.using plain js
  if we use plain js , it is very difficult to build large applications

2.using frameworks and libs

2000 - The first javascript framework - DOJO
2002-2005 - JQuery - is the second most powerfull dom lib.
After 2006 - many js libs and frameworks introduced.. 2008(Angular js) 2013(react)...

Popular DOM frameworks/lib:
1.React
2.Angular
3.Vue.js

.....................................................................................
			 Vue Application Types

Vue.js is a framework used to build different types of client side apps

1.Standalone script application
   Enchancing html(genereated by server) by adding javascript /js lib(jquery)
 
if you have traditional web apps written using server side techn like jsp,asp,php which has "js/jquery" lib

    Vue is Declarative  replacement of Imperative "Jquery"


2.Web Component
    Vue supports to create web component arch based applications

3.Single Page Web Application(SPA)
   Vue is Primarily popuplar for building spa applications

4.Full Stack /SSR - Server side Rendered apps.
 
  SSR =  SPA + Server Side Technologies

 Pure SPA's has limitations when the app is sensitive to SEO and time to constent.
 Every thing happens in the browser side with respective SPA.

 Vue apps can be compiled/render in the server side.
 Server will generate html pages before sending to the browser(client) - Pre  rendering.
 https://nuxtjs.org/ -  for ssr with vuejs

5.SSG/JAMStack
   Server side static file generation(96), instead of build dynamic apps, suppose we need static apps.

  Server-side rendering can be done ahead of time if the required data is static. This means we can pre-render an entire application into HTML and serve them as static files.

 This improves site performance and makes deployment a lot simpler since we no longer need to dynamically render pages on each request. 

Vue can still hydrate such applications to provide rich interactivity on the client. This technique is commonly referred to as Static-Site Generation (SSG), also known as JAMStack.

The Vue team maintains a static-site generator called VitePress, which powers this website you are reading right now! In addition, Nuxt also supports SSG. You can even mix SSR and SSG for different routes in the same Nuxt app.

https://jamstack.org/

vue supported frameworks - VitePress,Nuxt


Beyond the Web:
...............

Although Vue is primarily designed for building web applications, it is by no means limited to just the browser. You can:

Build desktop apps with Electron or Tauri
Build mobile apps with Ionic Vue
Build desktop and mobile apps from the same codebase with Quasar
Use Vue's Custom Renderer API to build custom renderers targeting WebGL or even the terminal!
....................................................................................

App selections:

Whether your app is legacy server side apps built using j2ee or .net,php,rails--->
 Standalone vue.js

Your app is api centeric(webservices)/microservices
   Vue can be used as "SPA"

SPA With SSR for better optimization and SEO ready

SPA and SSR With SSG/JAM Stack - where your app is having static data

create index.html outside src dir

index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

</html>


in order to integrate vue with existing html

you have to add script which is distributed by vue community via "cdn".

There are two builds:
1.dev build
2.prod build

Dev Build

<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>

You are running a development build of Vue.
Make sure to use the production build (*.prod.js) when deploying for production.


Prod Build
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.1.1/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script>


....................................................................................
Core concepts of Vue
....................
			   Vue Application

Vue is just javascript framework, offers apis,infrastructure to build "DOM" programming.

DOM Programming:
1.create element or elements 
   When we create elements we create tree model-DOM tree
2.update existing elements content
3.remove/delete existing element content and element itself
4.list/walk through tree
5.we may change style dynamically
6.we interact with ui and change the ui.


Vue is javascript dom programming framework 

There are two ways of programming in UI:

1.imperative programming
    The way of write program using complex logics, more boiler plate code.
eg:
  create element using plain js
  create element using jQuery

   <div id="root">

    </div>
    <script>
        function createElement() {
            console.log('create Element')
            const Heading = document.createElement('h1')
            Heading.innerHTML = 'Hello DOM!'
            Heading.style.color = 'blue'
            document.getElementById('root').appendChild(Heading)
        }
        createElement();
    </script>

2.declarative programming

 =>write less code
 =>Abstract DOM apis with readable constructs 
 =>introduce declarative templates

Note:
 Template driven technology introduced in server side computing in 1990's
 2006, the first template driven technology was introduced in javascript called
 mustache.js ( {{}}})
 Template = static + dynamic  content , where dynamic content is interpolated into code. 
 eg <h1>Hello {{name}} </h1>

 "Vue is based on declarative , which extends standard HTML with a template syntax"
				+
			   java script => binds the state(data)/ biz logic

HTML + Extra Syntax + Bizlogic+data = Vue.js
.....................................................................................

.....................................................................................
How vue represents UI?

=>Vue creates UI dynamically(DOM)
=>Vue organizes the UI into smaller and smaller UI
=>VUE breaks the complex UI into Smallary UI
    This model is called called as "Compostion"

Why Compostion?
=>The UI can be reused any where in the app and also outside app.
=>The code maintaince is very easy,because it is independant.

	    "The arch is called as Component Driven Arch"

Component means parts of something.

.....................................................................................
			 Vue Instance /Application Object
.....................................................................................

In vuejs, the whole application(User interface), is composed into the object called
"Vue instance".

Pro Vue 3

var app = new Vue({})

Vue 3:
We can get Vue instance:

 1.Via Globale Vue Variable
 2.Via ES  6 Modules


			A.Via Global Vue variable
...................................................................................
Getting Vue instance:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script>

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Vue Application Instance</h1>
  <script>
    //Vue is global Vue Variable which returns Vue instance
    const vueInstance = Vue 
    console.log(vueInstance)
    console.log(vueInstance.version)
  </script>  
</body>
</html>

....................................................................................
			B.Via Es 6 modules
.....................................................................................

can we use es 6 modules directly inside browser

No, in older browsers
yes in modern browsers

name.js
export const name='Subramanian'

index.js
import {name} from './name'

Generally browser has no facility to link files and share code using "ES 6 modules keyword "

How to run es 6 module based apps inside browsers

Solution:
1.Using build tools - webpack,rollup.
   React,angular uses this tool behind it.

2.Using browser alone
   using type=module

 Recently browsers vendors added a capability to link files at browser level, this is still in experimental mode- many browsers(old browsers may not support)

Dont Try this in production.
............................................................
			 Vue js and es 6 modules


2.Using browser alone
   Dynamically Import JavaScript with Import Maps

if you want import any js code within html file.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>    
    <script type="importmap">
        {
          "imports": {
          
          }
        }
      </script> 
</head>
<body>    
    <!-- <script src="src/index.js" type="module"></script> -->

</body>
</html>

Note:
Import Maps Browser Support

Import maps are supported by default in Chromium-based browsers, so we recommend using Chrome or Edge during the learning process.

If using Firefox, it is only supported in version 102+ and currently needs to be enabled via the dom.importMaps.enabled option in about:config.

If your preferred browser does not support import maps yet, you can polyfill it with es-module-shims.

    <script async src="https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.5.5/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>

Not for production

The import-maps-based setup is meant for learning only - if you intend to use Vue without build tools in production, make sure to check out the Production Deployment Guide.

Vue is Root Instance having lot methods (factory methods)

createApp: (...args) => {…}
createBlock: ƒ createBlock(type, props, children, patchFlag, dynamicProps)
createCommentVNode: ƒ createCommentVNode(text = '', // when used as the v-else branch, the comment node must be created as a // block to ensure correct updates. asBlock = false)
createElementBlock: ƒ createElementBlock(type, props, children, patchFlag, 
etc...

First UI:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- Polyfil lib for importmap -->
    <script async src="https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.5.5/dist/es-module-shims.js"></script>
    <script type="importmap">
        {
          "imports": {
              "vue":"https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.esm-browser.js"
          }
        }
      </script>
</head>

<body>

    <div id="root">
        <!-- Insert dom node -->
    </div>
    <script type="module">
        //step 1: import factory method
        import { createApp } from 'vue'
        //step 2: create app instance
        const app = createApp({
            template: `<h1> Welcome to Vue Application</h1>`
        })
        //Step 3: Mount the component into root element
        app.mount("#root")

    </script>
</body>

</html>
.....................................................................................
			  User interface Development
.....................................................................................

User interface development guidelines:

1.User interface must be broken into smallar and smallar -  Compostion - Component model

2.User interface is organized in hierachal structure -  Tree Structure 
  Thats where html has been designed.
 We need to follow html tree model

 <div>
    <div>
	<div>
	   
	</div>
	
    </div>
 </div>

3.In tree model there must be one root element
..................................................................................
				Root Component(root Element)


In React:
 function Logo(){
   
   return <img src="logo.png"/>
 
}
In Angular

 @Component({
   selector:'app-logo'
   template:`<img src="logo.png"/>
 }) 
 export class Logo{

 }
In Vue:
 Component is object which is represented as literal object.

const Logo ={

}
What component contains:

 component information can be categorized into various segments
